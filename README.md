Steven M. Satterfield, EdD



WELCOME to CS-340 â€“ Client/Server Development! 
Greetings, fellow software engineers! I am Dr. Satterfield, the course instructor, and I look forward to guiding you through this essential class! I have several years of classroom teaching experience and have been an adjunct faculty member at SNHU since 2023. More importantly, I have a lifetime of classroom experience as a student and fellow learner, over thirty years of experience in database software development, and several years of Cloud database experience. 

I am Honored to Work with You!
As SNHU students, many of you are professionals, continuing your studies while supporting families and working without neglecting your duties. Some of you may be digital natives, having interacted with computing devices since early childhood. People of my generation are digital immigrants, having first interacted with computing devices as adults. Therefore, I may struggle with a task that comes as naturally as breathing to you, or I may describe something like one who learned the concept as an adult and incorporated it into an existing framework from an earlier time. When that happens, please ask for clarification. Whatever your background or stage of life, I salute you, and I deeply respect your commitment to learning. We are cut from the same cloth.

While we may all come into this academic environment from different backgrounds and with different ideas and goals, I believe that as a community of scholars, each dedicated to taking positive action to learn and to better care for our families and loved ones, we have far more in common than we have differences. The political and economic marketplaces are determined to divide us up into categories primarily based on traits or attributes that are not even under individual control and, therefore, have nothing to do with our character or with making us who we are. Let us see each other as individuals coming together to study and learn in a place where we can each be who we are and celebrate our common bond and good fortune in taking this journey together.

About This Course
I am enthusiastic about this course because you will gain full-stack experience developing a software application front end, middle layer, and database back end. I became a software developer after a single course in computer programming during my first semester of graduate school sparked an interest. I eventually left my original field of study to work in software development. Only after several years did I pick up my studies again, this time in computer science. Many of you may be in similar situations in your careers. If so, try to incorporate what you already know into the framework of what we teach you. Based on my experience, many of you bring much prior knowledge from the field into the class.

During my thirty-plus years working and studying in the computer science domain, I have acquired significant knowledge, skills, and perspective in database design and software development, including hands-on experience, theory, best practices, and software development lifecycle (SDLC) processes. These are essential concepts for software development regardless of the programming language. Software development and database design are branches of engineering, and engineering requires not only a knowledge of state-of-the-art practices but also an adherence to best practices, basing your work on accepted standards, and making your work understandable and maintainable by other engineers.

I look forward to working with and getting to know each of you! May this be the beginning of a beautiful friendship for all of us!

Respectfully,

Dr. Satterfield
